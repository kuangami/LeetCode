1 | Two Sum | Easy | Hash Table | build hash table while searching
2 | Add Two Numbers | Medium | Linked List, Math | save a dummy head for output
7 | Reverse Integer | Easy | Math | test overflow
8 | String to Integer (atoi) | Easy | String | remove leading white spaces, test overflow
15 | 3Sum | Medium | Two Pointers | sort first, convert into two sum problem then approach from both sides
16 | 3Sum Closest | Medium | Two Pointers | calculate the absolute value
18 | 4Sum | Medium | Two Pointers | 4Sum -> 3Sum -> 2Sum
30 | Substring with Concatenation of All Words | Hard | Hash Table, String | build one hash table with the goal, update the other while searching
43 | Multiplt Strings | Medium | String, Math | use an array of integers to store results from multiplying single digit serparately
65 | Valid Number | Hard | String, Math | use two flags for '.' and 'e', check the number before and after 'e' for output
76 | Minimum Window Substring | Hard | Hash Table, Two Pointers, String | build hash table, move right pointer to match, move left pointer to find minimum
155 | Min Stack | Easy | Stack, Design | use two stacks to implement, keep the current minimum on the top
167 | Two Sum II - Input array is sorted | Medium | Two Pointers | approach from both sides
239 | Sliding Window Maximum | Hard | Queue | use a double-ended queue (deque) to store the potential maximum
306 | Additive Number | Medium | String, Math | handle leading zero cases and recursively test if it is additive
454 | 4Sum II | Medium | Hash Table | use hash table for search purpose
